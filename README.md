# Agile, Lean, and Rugged - The paper edition

Accompanying repository for the [Goto London 2015](http://gotocon.com/goto-london-2015/) Day 1 Keynote. Feel free to open any issues for questions and/or to say hi :)

## Abstract
Surprisingly enough academic papers can be interesting and very relevant to the work we do as computer science practitioners. Papers come in many kinds/ areas of focus and sometimes finding the right one can be difficult. Websites like [The Morning Paper](http://blog.acolyer.org/) and organizations like [Papers We Love](http://paperswelove.org/) aim to bring research closer to practitioners and we want you to be a part of them!

Join us for a guided tour of our favorite agile, lean, and rugged papers. We will explore papers that have laid the foundation of Computer Science and papers that push the boundaries of what we know using the three themes of our conference as guide.
